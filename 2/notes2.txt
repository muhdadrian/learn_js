ARITHMETIC OPERATOR:
1. arithmetic
2. assignment
3. comparison
4. logical
5. string
6. conditional
7. typeof

# arithmetic, assigment, comparison, logic and string are called binary operator - needs two operand:
operand1 operator operand2

# conditional - ternary operator: needs three operands

# typeof - unary operator - needs only an operand:
operator operand or,
operand operator

ARITHMETIC OPERATOR:
+, -, *, /, %

# operator precedence:
PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction | () * / + -

ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR:
=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=

x += y | x = x + y
x -= y | x = x - y
x *= y | x = x * y
x /= y | x = x / y
x %= y | x = x % y

COMPARISON OPERATOR:
1. ==
2. !=
3. === (recommended compared to ==)
4. !==
5. >
6. < 
7. >=
8. <=

#The comparison operators above will produce boolean results

LOGICAL OPERATOR:
1. &&
2. ||
3. ! - !(x < 20)

STRING OPERATOR:
+ , in JS if the operand is number it's arithemtic operator and if the operand is string, it's concatenation.

TYPEOF OPERATOR:
typeof(10)
'number'
typeof('10') 
'string'
typeof(true)
'boolean'

CONDITIONAL OPERATOR:
(condition) ? true : false
#if the condition is true, the true value will be displayed, if false, the false value will be displayed

(x % 2 ==0) ? "even" : "odd"

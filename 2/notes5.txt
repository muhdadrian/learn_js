VARIABLES:

To understand variables, you must understand three things:
1. Declaration - to declare variable.
2. Initialization - to provide memory for variable.
3. Assignment - to assign a value to variable.

var x; - to declare and initialize x variable.
x = 20; - to assign to the x variable;

#always try to declare and initialize first before doing the assignment.

Variable Declaration:
1. var 
2. let
3. const

# We'll use var (simplest) here first. When we already expert and understand about JS, we'll discuss the other two keywords. 

#camelCase that is commonly used by JS programmer:

var longVariableName;

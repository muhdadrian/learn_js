//1. join
var arr = ['Adrian', 'Hafizah', 'children'];
console.log(arr); //this will display in object and the users do not want to see the object. So use join method instead

console.log(arr.join()); //the display will look clean separated by comma by default
console.log(arr.join(' - ')); //to change comma to -

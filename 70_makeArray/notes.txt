array is a variable but more powerful, as it can contain more than a value

array:
1. key (index) and value pair
2. its data type is object. In other programming language, array is its own data type.  
3. array in JS has function or method to calculate the total element inside it.
4. element in array can contain different data type just like in PHP. In C or Java all data type must be the same in array.

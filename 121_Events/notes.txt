way to make event:
1. Event Handler:
- Inline HTML Attribute (not recommended as you mixed the HMTL with JS & we modified the HMTL, while we actually can add event without messing the HMTL)
- Element Method
2. addEventListener() 

# the second one above is newer than the first one

What is the difference between Event Handler and addEventListener()?
- Event Handler - the last change will replace the previous one, while addEventListener will add the change

# You can use Event Handler or addEventListener, but don't use Inline Event Handler - Sandhika Galih

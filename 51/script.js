var a = 1; //this is called global scope / window scope. It means that var a is a global variable that can be used anywhere in our program

//If you type a in console, the value of number 1 will be displayed

//Why it is called window scope? It is in window's object (objek paling luar didalam browser kita). Type in console window.a | window.a === a
